MULTIPLEXERS AND DECODERS

  multiplexer - choose an output from among several possible inputs based on the value of a select signal
  
    use SOP or POS in truth table/K map to figure out the expression
    
    can also be built off of tri-state buffers - one tristate buffer is always active
    
    Wider Multiplexers: 4:1 = 4 inputs - 1 output; 2 select signals needed
    
    Multiplexer Logic: 
      
      muxes can be used as lookup tables (LUTs) to perform logic functions
      
      a 2^N input mux can be programmed to perform any N-input logic function
  
  decoder - has N inputs and 2^N outputs
