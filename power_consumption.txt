power consumption: amount of energy used per unit time

  digital systems draw both 'dynamic' and 'static' power 
  
      dynamic -> power used to chrge capacitance as signals change between 0 and 1
      static  -> power used even when signals do not change and system is idle
      
  logic gates + wires that connect them have capactiance
  
      C - capacitance (ability of a system to store an electric charge)  
      energy drawn from power supply to charge C to voltage V(DD) is *****CV(DD)^2*****
      if the voltage on the capacitor switches at frequency f (f times/sec), it charges the capacitor f/2 times + discharges f/2 times/sec
      discharging does not draw energy from power supply, so the dynamic power consumption is 
      
                                              ***** P(dynamic) = 1/2 (CV(DD)^2)f *****
  
  electrical systems draw some current even when they are idle - so when transistors are off, they stil leak a small amount of current
      the total static current (I(DD)) = leakage current = quiescent supply current flowing between V(DD) and GND
      
                                        ***** static power consumption = (I(DD))*(V(DD)) *****
